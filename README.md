# dsc2-regression
Application of DSC2 framework to a range of regression models.

The first version of this benchmark was adapted from [[1]](https://github.com/xiangzhu/dscr_en) and [[2]](https://github.com/mengyin/dscr-example), both of which are developed under [DSCR](https://github.com/stephens999/dscr) framework. To run this benchmark you need to install the Python (minimum version required is 3.6) program `dsc`:

pip install dsc
```
If you run into issues with the installation please find more information on the DSC2 [installation guide](https://stephenslab.github.io/dsc-wiki/manual/installation.html).
